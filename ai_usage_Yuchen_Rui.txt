1. What AI tool did you use?
I used ChatGPT

2. How did you use it? What kind of questions did you ask?

I asked ChatGPT for help with planning and reviewing the login and personal page functionality for my project. Specifically, I provided the gameplay description and asked for feedback on whether my current design logic met the requirements. I did not ask it to write complete code for me, but I did use it for:

- Clarifying how to structure user login flow using Flask sessions.
- Checking if my personal profile route should be protected via login.
- Reviewing general ideas for what should appear on the personal page (e.g., game history, attempts left).
- Getting feedback on how to handle user sessions, password storage, and redirect logic securely.
- Asking how to document AI usage in compliance with course policy.

ChatGPT helped me organize my thoughts, but I wrote all of the actual code (Flask routes, templates, session management) by myself.

There is no full code snippet generated by AI used in my submission. The assistant provided only conceptual guidance and best practices.

3. How much did it help you? How helpful and accurate was it?

It was moderately helpful. ChatGPT helped me think through edge cases like session expiration and gave high-level architecture ideas. It reminded me to hash passwords and check for login status on protected pages.

I double-checked all suggestions with Flask documentation before writing the code myself. Iâ€™d say it helped improve my code design and saved me time thinking through structure and logic. It did not write any actual code for my project.
